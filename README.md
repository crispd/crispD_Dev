Initialized on GitHub. Was to be filled with MinimalDLine folder from I: drive for further development of template based screen generation. But now may include o.c.rocs.feature to study it's method of screen generation.\
The comparison of the two methods could lead to a better understanding of methods involved. And the use of an independent repository for exploration will help test git functionality for bugs and further practice with \
Git protocol and eclipse's utilization of local space.
